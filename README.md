# Wordie

Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored (green, yellow and gray) tiles showing when letters match or already being used in the correct position.

## Instructions

The aim of Wordie is to guess the correct Wordie, so to begin, simply enter any five-letter word and look at the results.

The game play is as follows:

- Shoot a word as a guess for the hidden word.

- Any letters which are within the hidden target word are colored in yellow.

- Any letters which match exactly the letter in the hidden target word are colored green

- Tinker a new candidate word as a guess for the hidden target word, and go back to Step 1.
